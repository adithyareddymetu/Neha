1)customers: A data frame containing customer information.
2)orders: A data frame containing orders with customer IDs and product names.
3)inner_join(orders, by = "customer_id"): Performs an inner join on customer_id to get the matching records from both data frames.
4)select(customer_name, product_name): Selects only the customer name and product name from the joined data.
